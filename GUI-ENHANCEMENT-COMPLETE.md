## 🎯 Usage Instructions

### Starting the Enhanced GUI

```bash
cd c:\dev
python beca_gui.py
```

The GUI will launch at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`

### Using the File Tree Panel (Left)
1. **View project structure** - See all files and folders up to 4 levels deep
2. **Check file status** - NEW and MODIFIED badges appear automatically
3. **Monitor changes** - Tree refreshes after BECA creates/modifies files
4. **Manual refresh** - Click "🔄 Refresh Tree" button anytime

### Using the Code Viewer (Right Panel - View File Tab)
1. **Enter file path** (e.g., `src/langchain_agent.py`)
2. **Click "View"** to see syntax-highlighted code
3. **Use "Refresh"** to reload after changes
4. **Scroll** to browse long files (max height: 600px)

### Using the Diff Viewer (Right Panel - Diff Tab)
1. **First view a file** using the "View File" tab
2. **Let BECA modify the file** (or modify it yourself)
3. **Switch to "Diff" tab**
4. **Enter same file path** and click "Show Diff"
5. **Review changes** with color-coded additions/deletions

### Chat with BECA (Middle Panel)
- **Ask BECA to create files** - They'll appear in the file tree with NEW badge
- **Request modifications** - Modified files get MODIFIED badge
- **View created files** - Copy the path and view in Code Viewer tab
- **All features work together** - Chat, file tree, and code viewer stay in sync

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Component Hierarchy

```
beca_gui.py (Main Gradio Interface)
├── File Tree Panel (Left)
│   └── gui_utils.FileTreeManager
│       └── file_tracker.FileOperationTracker
├── Chat Panel (Middle)
│   └── langchain_agent.chat_with_agent
│       └── langchain_tools.BECA_TOOLS
│           └── file_tracker (notifies on file ops)
└── Code View Panel (Right)
    ├── View File Tab
    │   └── gui_utils.CodeViewer
    └── Diff Tab
        └── gui_utils.DiffViewer
```

### Data Flow

1. **User sends message** → Agent executes tools
2. **Tool creates/modifies file** → file_tracker.mark_file_*()
3. **Agent returns response** → GUI refreshes file tree
4. **User views file** → CodeViewer highlights code
5. **User checks diff** → DiffViewer compares versions

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Dependencies Used
- **gradio**: Web GUI framework
- **pygments**: Syntax highlighting (200+ languages)
- **watchdog**: File system watching (installed, not yet active)
- **langchain**: Agent framework (existing)

### Supported Languages
Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX, HTML, CSS, JSON, Markdown, YAML, Shell, PowerShell, Go, Rust, Java, C, C++, PHP, Ruby, SQL, and more...

### Performance Considerations
- **File tree depth limited** to 4 levels (configurable)
- **Code preview limited** to 600px height (scrollable)
- **Diff context** shows full changes with line numbers
- **Ignored directories**: `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `google-cloud-sdk`

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### First Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run tests
python test_gui.py

# 3. Launch GUI
python beca_gui.py

# 4. Open browser to http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

### Example Workflow
1. **Start BECA**: `python beca_gui.py`
2. **Ask BECA**: "Create a simple Flask app called myapi"
3. **Watch**: File tree shows new myapi/ folder with NEW badges
4. **View**: Enter `myapi/app.py` in Code Viewer
5. **Modify**: Ask BECA to "Add a health check endpoint"
6. **Diff**: Switch to Diff tab and see the changes

## 📝 Notes

### Design Decisions
- **Gradio over custom React**: Faster implementation, integrates with existing code
- **Pygments over Monaco Editor**: Easier to embed, no JavaScript bundle needed
- **HTML rendering**: Leverages Gradio's HTML component for flexibility
- **File tracker pattern**: Observer pattern for decoupled GUI updates

### Known Limitations
- **No real-time collaboration** - Single user only
- **No file editing** - Read-only for now (by design)
- **No search in file tree** - Can be added later
- **Limited to local files** - No remote file system support
