# BECA Self-Awareness Improvements

## Problem
BECA was struggling to understand her own codebase and capabilities when asked. She would suggest external tools like `clone_and_learn` instead of simply reading her own files.

## Root Cause
1. **Overly restrictive prompt** - Told her not to use tools for questions "about herself"
2. **No self-knowledge** - She didn't have information about her own architecture in memory
3. **Conservative model parameters** - Limited response length and context window

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt
**File:** `C:\dev\src\langchain_agent.py`

Added explicit instructions:
- Location of her codebase (C:\dev and C:\dev\src)
- Her main files and what they do
- Clear examples showing when to use tools vs answer directly
- Specific instruction: "DON'T suggest clone_and_learn for your own code - you already have access!"

### 2. Self-Knowledge Database
**File:** `C:\dev\initialize_beca_self_knowledge.py`

Created initialization script that adds to knowledge base:
- System architecture overview
- Complete tool catalog with descriptions
- File structure and organization

Run with: `python initialize_beca_self_knowledge.py`

### 3. Improved Model Parameters
**Changed in:** `langchain_agent.py`

Before:
```python
temperature=0.3
num_predict=256  # Too short
num_ctx=2048     # Too small
```

After:
```python
temperature=0.4   # More diverse responses
num_predict=512   # Longer, complete answers
num_ctx=4096      # Better context understanding
```

### 4. Example-Driven Learning
Added concrete examples in the prompt showing:
- How to review her own codebase
- When to use tools vs direct answers
- Proper tool usage patterns

## Testing
After restarting BECA, try:
1. "Review your own codebase and understand your capabilities"
   - Should use `list_files` and `read_file` immediately

2. "What tools do you have?"
   - Should read `langchain_tools.py` and summarize

3. "Show me your architecture"
   - Should read key files and explain

## Files Modified
- ✅ `C:\dev\src\langchain_agent.py` - Enhanced prompt and model params
- ✅ `C:\dev\src\knowledge_system.py` - Fixed SQLite threading
- ✅ `C:\dev\initialize_beca_self_knowledge.py` - New self-knowledge loader

## Next Steps
1. **Restart BECA** to pick up the new prompt: `python C:\dev\beca_gui.py`
2. Test with self-awareness questions
3. If still having issues, check the terminal output for tool usage patterns
