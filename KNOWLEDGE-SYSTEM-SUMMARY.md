- **6 Database Tables**: documentation, code_patterns, learning_resources, tool_knowledge, ai_model_knowledge, codebase_insights

### 2. Knowledge Tools ([knowledge_tools.py](src/knowledge_tools.py))
- `learn_from_documentation` - Scrape and index docs from URLs
- `save_code_pattern` - Save reusable code patterns
- `search_knowledge` - Search the knowledge base
- `add_learning_resource` - Queue resources to study
- `get_learning_queue` - View learning priorities
- `learn_ai_model_knowledge` - Build AI/ML expertise
- `learn_tool_knowledge` - Index development tools
- `auto_learn_from_urls` - Batch learning from multiple URLs

### 3. Codebase Explorer ([codebase_explorer.py](src/codebase_explorer.py))
- `analyze_repository` - Analyze local repo structure and patterns
- `analyze_code_patterns` - Extract patterns from code files
- `clone_and_learn` - Clone GitHub repos and analyze them
- `extract_function_signatures` - Document APIs and interfaces

### 4. AI Model Tools ([ai_model_tools.py](src/ai_model_tools.py))
- `explore_ollama_models` - List available local models
- `show_model_info` - Get detailed model information
- `create_modelfile` - Create custom Ollama models
- `fine_tune_guidance` - Step-by-step fine-tuning instructions
- `setup_training_environment` - Bootstrap ML training projects
