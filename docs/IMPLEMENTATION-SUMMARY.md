## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd c:\dev

# 2. Run tests (optional)
python test_gui.py

# 3. Launch GUI
python beca_gui.py

# 4. Open browser

```

### Example Session
1. **Start**: GUI shows file tree on left, empty chat in middle
2. **Chat**: "Create a simple React todo app"
3. **Observe**: File tree updates with new folders/files
4. **View**: Enter `todo-app/src/App.jsx` in Code Viewer
5. **See**: Syntax-highlighted React code
6. **Modify**: "Add delete functionality to the todo app"
7. **Compare**: Switch to Diff tab, see changes

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Went Well
1. **Gradio Integration** - Perfect fit for rapid development
2. **Pygments** - Excellent syntax highlighting, easy to use
3. **Modular Design** - Clean separation makes testing easy
4. **File Tracker Pattern** - Observer pattern works perfectly
5. **Test-First Approach** - Caught issues early

### Technical Highlights
1. **Zero external dependencies** (beyond Python packages)
2. **No JavaScript needed** - Pure Python solution
3. **Responsive layout** - Works on different screen sizes
4. **Graceful degradation** - Missing components don't crash

### Design Decisions
- **HTML components** over custom Gradio components (faster)
- **Unified diff** over side-by-side (simpler, clearer)
- **Pygments** over Monaco Editor (no JS bundle)
- **Observer pattern** for file tracking (decoupled)
- **Max depth limit** on file tree (performance)
