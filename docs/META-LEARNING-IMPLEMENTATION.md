## How It Works

### Development Workflow

```
1. Start Session
   ↓
2. Log Interactions (Planning → Implementation → Testing)
   ↓
3. Extract Patterns (Approaches, Schemas, Testing, Problems)
   ↓
4. Save Lessons Learned
   ↓
5. Score Quality (Code, Tests, Documentation)
   ↓
6. Create Template (if quality >= 0.8)
   ↓
7. Review Dashboard
```

### Learning Feedback Loop

```
Feature N Development
   ↓
Extract Patterns → Save as Lessons
   ↓
Feature N+1 Development
   ↓
Retrieve Relevant Lessons → Apply to New Feature
   ↓
Better Implementation (Higher Quality Score)
   ↓
Extract Enhanced Patterns → Save as Improved Lessons
   ↓
Continuous Improvement...
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.meta_learning_system import MetaLearningSystem

ml.log_development_interaction(...)
patterns = ml.extract_patterns_from_session(...)
ml.save_lessons_learned(...)
ml.score_implementation_quality(...)
```

### With Learning Context
```python
# Before starting new feature
context = ml.generate_learning_context("NewFeature", "feature_type")
prompt = f"Build feature\n\n{context}"
# Use prompt with injected learnings

## Conclusion

The BECA Meta-Learning System is fully implemented, tested, and documented. It transforms BECA from a tool executor into a learning system that continuously improves with each feature built. The system creates a positive feedback loop where:

1. Every development interaction is captured
2. Successful patterns are automatically extracted
3. Quality is measured and tracked
4. Templates are created from high-quality work
5. Past learnings are applied to new features
6. Progress is visualized through the dashboard

BECA now has the ability to learn from its own development process, making it progressively smarter with each feature built.
