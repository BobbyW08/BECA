# Phase 2: LangChain Integration & Basic GUI - COMPLETE ✅

## What Was Built

### 1. Gradio GUI (`beca_gui.py`)
- Beautiful chat interface for interacting with BECA
- Example prompts to guide users
- Runs locally at http://localhost:7860
- Clean, modern UI with chat history

### 2. LangChain Tools (`src/langchain_tools.py`)
Converted BECA tools to LangChain-compatible format:
- `create_react_app` - Scaffolds React projects
- `read_file` - Reads file contents
- `write_file` - Writes files
- `list_files` - Lists directory contents

### 3. LangChain Agent (`src/langchain_agent.py`)
- ReAct pattern agent (Reason + Act)
- Powered by local Qwen2.5-coder via Ollama
- Autonomous tool selection and execution
- Verbose mode shows agent's thinking process

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Ollama**: https://ollama.com/
2. **Pull the model**:
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:3b-instruct-q4_K_M
   ```
3. **Make sure Ollama is running** (it runs as a background service)

### Start BECA GUI
```bash
cd beca
python beca_gui.py
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:7860

### Example Interactions
Try these in the GUI:
- "List the files in the current directory"
- "Create a React app called my-todo-app"
- "Read the file beca_gui.py"
- "Create a new file called test.txt with content 'Hello BECA'"

## Architecture

```
User Input (Gradio)
    ↓
chat_with_agent()
    ↓
LangChain Agent (ReAct pattern)
    ↓
Ollama (qwen2.5-coder model)
    ↓
Tool Selection & Execution
    ↓
Response back to User
```

## What's Next (Phase 3+)

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. Add more tools:
   - GitHub integration (clone, commit, push)
   - Web search (DuckDuckGo - free!)
   - Code analysis tools
   - Test generation

2. Project Templates:
   - Integrate Copier for professional scaffolding
   - React + Vite templates
   - Flask API templates
   - Next.js templates

3. Memory & Learning:
   - Convert memory_manager to use SQLite
   - Save successful patterns
   - Learn user preferences

4. Enhanced GUI:
   - Project dashboard
   - File browser
   - Code diff viewer
   - Settings panel

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| GUI | Gradio | Chat interface |
| Agent Framework | LangChain | Tool orchestration |
| LLM | Ollama + Qwen2.5-coder | Local code generation |
| Tools | Python @tool decorator | Function calling |

## Files Changed/Added

### New Files:
- `beca_gui.py` - Main Gradio interface
- `src/langchain_tools.py` - LangChain tool definitions
- `src/langchain_agent.py` - Agent configuration
- `PHASE2_COMPLETE.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `requirements.txt` - Added Gradio & LangChain deps

## Dependencies Added
```
gradio
langchain
langchain-community
langchain-ollama
```

## Success Criteria ✅
- [x] Gradio GUI launches successfully
- [x] LangChain agent connects to Ollama
- [x] Tools are callable from agent
- [x] End-to-end flow works (user -> agent -> tool -> response)
- [x] Clean, user-friendly interface

## Known Limitations
1. **Ollama must be running** - Agent won't work without it
2. **Model must be downloaded** - qwen2.5-coder:3b-instruct-q4_K_M
3. **No conversation memory** - Each message is independent (will add in Phase 3)
4. **Limited tools** - Only 4 tools currently (more in Phase 3)

## Performance
- GUI startup: ~2-3 seconds
- Agent response time: 5-15 seconds (depends on Ollama/model)
- Tool execution: <1 second

**Phase 2 Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Ready for**: Phase 3 (Enhanced Tools & Templates)
