## üìö How to Use BECA's Learning Capabilities

### 1. Learning from Documentation

**Tell BECA to learn from any documentation URL:**

```
"Learn from the FastAPI documentation at https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/"
```

BECA will:
- Scrape the content
- Index it in her knowledge base
- Remember it for future reference

**Example commands:**
- "Learn about PyTorch from https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html"
- "Study the React documentation and save it"
- "Index the Transformers library docs for future use"

### 2. Searching Her Knowledge

**Ask BECA to recall previous learnings:**

```
"Search your knowledge for FastAPI routing patterns"
```

BECA will search her indexed documentation, code patterns, and other knowledge.

**Example commands:**
- "What do you know about async/await in Python?"
- "Search your knowledge base for error handling patterns"
- "Find what you learned about model fine-tuning"

### 3. Saving Code Patterns

**When BECA discovers useful code, she can save it:**

```
"Save this error handling pattern for future reuse:
try:
    result = await api_call()
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f'API failed: {e}')
    return None
"
```

**You can also tell her to save patterns:**
- "Save the async context manager pattern we just created"
- "Remember this authentication decorator for future projects"

### 4. Building a Learning Queue

**Queue up resources for BECA to study:**

```
"Add this tutorial to your learning queue: https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/"
```

BECA maintains a prioritized list of resources to learn from.

**Check her queue:**
```
"Show me your learning queue"
```

### 5. Learning from Codebases
