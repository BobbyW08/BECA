vinta/awesome-python - Curated list of Python frameworks and libraries

Phase 3: AI/ML Infrastructure & Models
Frameworks & Documentation:

PyTorch (pytorch.org) - Leading deep learning framework
TensorFlow (tensorflow.org) - Google's ML platform
Hugging Face (huggingface.co/docs) - Transformers, models, and datasets
LangChain Docs (python.langchain.com) - LLM application framework
OpenAI Cookbook (github.com/openai/openai-cookbook) - Practical examples

MLOps & Infrastructure:

Ray (docs.ray.io) - Distributed computing for AI
MLflow - ML lifecycle management
Weights & Biases Docs - Experiment tracking
FastAPI (fastapi.tiangolo.com) - Modern API framework (essential for AI services)

Phase 4: Template & Boilerplate Libraries
GitHub Organizations to Mine:

Vercel (github.com/vercel) - Next.js templates and examples
Awesome Lists (github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) - Curated lists for every technology
Cookiecutter (github.com/cookiecutter) - Project templates for Python, Django, Flask
shadcn/ui - Modern React component templates
saadeghi/daisyui - Tailwind CSS component library

Full-Stack Starters:

t3-oss/create-t3-app - TypeScript, Next.js, Prisma, tRPC
tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-template - FastAPI + React
django-cookiecutter - Production-ready Django setup

Phase 5: Advanced Code Study
Production-Grade Codebases to Analyze:

Django (github.com/django/django) - Study the source for architecture patterns
Flask (github.com/pallets/flask) - Learn minimalist design
FastAPI (github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) - Modern async patterns
React (github.com/facebook/react) - Component architecture
Transformers (github.com/huggingface/transformers) - ML model implementation

Code Quality & Patterns:

Google Style Guides (google.github.io/styleguide) - Python, JavaScript, etc.
Refactoring.guru - Design patterns explained clearly
patterns.dev - Modern web app patterns

Phase 6: Specialized AI Agent Development
Essential for AI Agents:

LangChain - Agent frameworks and chains
AutoGPT (github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT) - Autonomous agent patterns
guidance (github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) - Controlling LLM output
DSPy (github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) - Programming with foundation models
Instructor (github.com/jxnl/instructor) - Structured outputs from LLMs

Phase 7: Discovery & Tool Finding Skills
Search Strategies for BECA:

GitHub Topics (github.com/topics) - Browse by technology tags
GitHub Trending (github.com/trending) - Discover emerging tools daily
Papers With Code (paperswithcode.com) - ML papers + implementation code
Stack Overflow - Practical problem-solving patterns
Dev.to & Hashnode - Developer tutorials and guides

Package Registries:

PyPI (pypi.org) - All Python packages
npm (npmjs.com) - JavaScript packages
Docker Hub - Pre-built containers

Phase 8: Continuous Learning
Stay Current:

GitHub Explore - Daily digests
Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com) - Tech discussions
Reddit (r/programming, r/MachineLearning, r/webdev)
awesome-selfhosted - Self-hosted software alternatives


Recommended Learning Sequence:

Week 1-2: MDN Web Docs + JavaScript.info for foundations
Week 3-4: Real Python tutorials + official Python docs
Week 5-6: FastAPI documentation + build a simple API
Week 7-8: Hugging Face tutorials + LangChain docs
Week 9-10: Study 3-5 production codebases from above
Week 11-12: Build projects combining all skills
Ongoing: Daily GitHub Trending + new tool discovery

Key Principle: For every technology BECA encounters, teach it to find the official documentation FIRST, then community resources, then example implementations on GitHub.
