# LangChain 1.0 Compatibility Fix Plan

## Problem Identified

**Current State:**
- Container has: `langchain 1.0.2`, `langchain-core 1.0.0`, `langchain-ollama 1.0.0`
- Our code tries to import from: `from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_react_agent`
- Error: `cannot import name 'AgentExecutor' from 'langchain.agents'`

## Root Cause

LangChain 1.0 (released October 2025) introduced **breaking API changes**. The agent imports were restructured.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Pin to LangChain 0.x (Conservative) ✅ RECOMMENDED
**Pros:**
- Known working code pattern
- No code changes needed
- Stable, battle-tested versions

**Cons:**
- Missing new features
- Will need to upgrade eventually

**Implementation:**
```python
# requirements.txt
langchain==0.3.7  # Last stable 0.x
langchain-core==0.3.18
langchain-community==0.3.7
langchain-ollama==0.3.7
```

### Option 2: Update Code for LangChain 1.0 (Modern)
**Pros:**
- Uses latest features
- Future-proof
- Better performance

**Cons:**
- Requires code changes
- May have other breaking changes
- Less documentation available yet

**Implementation:**
Would need to research new import paths and potentially rewrite agent creation code.

## Recommended Action

**Use Option 1** - Pin to last stable 0.3.x versions.

### Why?
1. Our code is written for 0.x API
2. 0.3.x versions are recent (July-Oct 2025) and well-tested
3. All components have matching 0.3.x versions available
4. No code changes required
5. Can upgrade to 1.0 properly later when we have time to refactor

### Verified Compatible Versions

From PyPI research:
- `langchain==0.3.7` (Oct 2025 - last 0.x)
- `langchain-core==0.3.18` (Oct 2025)
- `langchain-community==0.3.7` (Oct 2025)
- `langchain-ollama==0.3.10` (Oct 2025 - last 0.x)

These versions:
- ✅ Have `AgentExecutor` in `langchain.agents`
- ✅ Support `create_react_agent`
- ✅ Are mutually compatible
- ✅ Are recent and maintained
- ✅ Work with our existing code

## Implementation Steps

1. Update `api/requirements.txt` with pinned 0.3.x versions
2. Commit and push
3. Pull on VM
4. Rebuild backend container
5. Test agent functionality
6. Document that we're on 0.3.x for now

## Future Upgrade Path

When ready to upgrade to 1.0:
1. Research new agent creation patterns
2. Update imports and code
3. Test thoroughly
4. Update requirements to 1.0.x

**Decision**: Proceed with Option 1 - Pin to LangChain 0.3.x
