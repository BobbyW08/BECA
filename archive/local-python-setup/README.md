# Local Python Setup - Archived

**Date Archived**: October 16, 2025  
**Reason**: Switched to Docker/cloud deployment for cleaner setup

---

## What's in This Archive

This folder contains the local Python setup that was created before we decided to use the Docker/cloud deployment exclusively.

### Files
1. **requirements-optimized.txt** - Optimized Python dependencies (18 packages)
2. **START-BECA-local-python.md** - Instructions for running BECA locally

---

## Why We Archived This

### The Problem
- User was trying to start BECA locally but getting `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gradio'`
- The `beca-env` virtual environment had no packages installed
- There were conflicting instructions (Docker vs local Python)

### The Solution
- Realized the Docker/cloud setup was already working and preferred
- Docker approach is cleaner: no local Python setup needed
- Works from any device (Windows, iPad, Mac)
- All dependencies managed in containers

---

## What We Learned

### Package Optimization Work
The `requirements-optimized.txt` file represents good work analyzing and reducing dependencies:
- **Before**: 109 packages
- **After**: 18 essential packages
- **Removed**: 
  - Audio processing (not used)
  - Local file parsing (Google Drive handles this)
  - Redundant dependencies

### Key Packages (If You Ever Need Local Setup)

## When to Use This

### Use Local Python Setup If:
- You want to develop BECA locally
- You need to debug Python code directly
- You want to modify BECA without rebuilding containers
- You're working on BECA's source code

### Use Docker/Cloud Setup If:
- You just want to USE BECA (recommended)
- You want to access from iPad/mobile
- You don't want to manage Python environments
- You want simple start/stop with batch files

## How to Restore Local Setup (If Needed)

1. **Create virtual environment**:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\dev
   python -m venv beca-env
   .\beca-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r archive/local-python-setup/requirements-optimized.txt
   ```

3. **Run BECA locally**:
   ```powershell
   python beca_gui.py
   ```
   Access at: http://127.0.0.1:7860

4. **Connect to cloud Ollama**:
   - Make sure VM is running
   - BECA will connect to http://34.46.140.140:11434
   - No changes needed - already configured in code

## Reusable for Other Projects

This optimization work can be applied to other AI agent projects:

### Pattern: "Dependency Bloat Analysis"
1. List all installed packages
2. Check which are actually imported
3. Identify optional features
4. Remove unnecessary packages
5. Document what each package does

### Savings Example
- Time: 5 min install → 1-2 min install
- Disk: 250MB → 170MB
- Clarity: Much easier to see what's essential

---

## Future Use Cases

Save this pattern to BECA's knowledge base for:
- Other AI agent deployments
- Containerizing Python apps
- Optimizing Python dependencies
- Choosing between local vs cloud deployment
