# Phase 1 Testing & Startup Reliability Improvements

## Objective
Test the deployed agent timeout fix and achieve 100% reliable startup before moving to Phase 2.

## Testing Plan

### 1. Agent Timeout Fix Verification
- [ ] Test agent with complex multi-step task
- [ ] Verify no iteration limit errors
- [ ] Confirm agent completes tasks successfully
- [ ] Monitor execution time (should be < 10 minutes per task)

### 2. Startup Reliability Improvements
- [ ] Add health check polling before opening browser
- [ ] Implement retry logic for container startup
- [ ] Add verbose status messages during startup
- [ ] Create startup validation script
- [ ] Improve error messages when things fail

### 3. Health Check System
- [ ] Backend health endpoint verification
- [ ] Frontend availability check
- [ ] Ollama model ready check
- [ ] Container status verification
- [ ] Automatic retry on failure

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create test script** to verify agent functionality
2. **Enhance start-beca.bat** with health checks
3. **Add startup-validator.bat** for diagnostics
4. **Test end-to-end** startup process
5. **Document improvements**

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Agent completes complex tasks without timeout
- ✅ Startup works 100% of the time
- ✅ Clear error messages when issues occur
- ✅ Automatic retry on transient failures
- ✅ User sees real-time status during startup
