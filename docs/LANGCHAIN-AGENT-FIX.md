# LangChain Agent Fix - Tool Execution Issue

## Problem
BECA was returning raw JSON function calls like `{"type": "function", "name": "explore_ollama_models"}` instead of actually executing the tools and returning results to the user.

## Root Cause
The issue was with using `create_tool_calling_agent` with Ollama models. While llama3.1:8b supports tool calling, LangChain's implementation wasn't properly parsing and executing the tool calls with Ollama's response format.

## Solution
Switched from `create_tool_calling_agent` to `create_react_agent` which uses the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern. This approach:

1. **Better Compatibility**: ReAct agents work more reliably with Ollama models
2. **Explicit Format**: Uses a clear Thought/Action/Observation loop that the model can follow
3. **Tool Execution**: Properly executes tools and returns results instead of raw JSON

## Changes Made

### File: `src/langchain_agent.py`

**Before (Tool Calling Agent):**
```python
from langchain.agents import create_tool_calling_agent

llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(BECA_TOOLS)
agent = create_tool_calling_agent(
    llm=llm_with_tools,
    tools=BECA_TOOLS,
    prompt=agent_prompt,
)
```

**After (ReAct Agent):**
```python
from langchain.agents import create_react_agent

react_prompt_template = """You are BECA...

Use the following format EXACTLY:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
"""

agent = create_react_agent(
    llm=llm,
    tools=BECA_TOOLS,
    prompt=agent_prompt,
)
```

## Testing
To verify the fix works:

1. Go to http://34.55.204.139:7860
2. Ask BECA: "What models are you running?"
3. **Expected**: BECA should execute the `explore_ollama_models` tool and return a list of models
4. **Previous Behavior**: Would return raw JSON like `{"type": "function", "name": "explore_ollama_models"}`

## Other Test Cases
- "List files in the current directory" → Should use `list_files` tool
- "What tools do you have?" → Should use `read_file` to check langchain_tools.py
- "Create a new React app" → Should ask for project name first

## Deployment
```bash
# Files updated
- src/langchain_agent.py

# Deployment steps completed
1. Updated langchain_agent.py locally
2. Copied to VM: gcloud compute scp src/langchain_agent.py beca-ollama:/opt/beca/src/
3. Restarted container: sudo docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml restart beca-agent
```

## Status
✅ Fix deployed to VM at 34.55.204.139:7860  
⏳ Awaiting user testing to confirm tools execute properly

## Technical Details

### ReAct Pattern Benefits
1. **Structured Format**: Model follows a clear pattern that's easier to parse
2. **Explicit Tool Use**: Model must explicitly state Action and wait for Observation
3. **Better Debugging**: Verbose output shows the Thought/Action/Observation loop
4. **Ollama Compatibility**: Works reliably with open-source models like llama3.1

### Agent Executor Settings
```python
AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent,
    tools=BECA_TOOLS,
    verbose=True,
    max_iterations=10,      # Allow multiple tool uses
    max_execution_time=60,  # 60 second timeout
    return_intermediate_steps=True,
    early_stopping_method="force",
)
```

## Next Steps
1. User tests BECA at http://34.55.204.139:7860
2. Verify tools are executed properly
3. If successful, move to next set of tasks per user's request
